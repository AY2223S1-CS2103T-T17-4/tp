### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Appointment` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and all `Appointment` objects (which are contained in a
`UniqueAppointmentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects and `Appointment` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as separate _filtered_ lists which are exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Appointment>` respectively that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save idENTify data, command history data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Implemented\] List patients/appointments feature

#### Implementation
The list patients/appointments mechanism is facilitated by the `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueAppointmentList`
respectively. They extend `Iterable` and store lists of `Person` and `Appointment`.

An example usage scenario of list patients/appointments is given below:


**Steps:**
1. After launching the application, user executes the command `find alex` to search for entries in both
`UniquePersonList` and `UniqueAppointmentList` that contains "alex". This causes entries in the list which
does not contain "alex" to be hidden from the GUI. This will set the premise of using `list patients` and
`list appts`.

2. When user wants to view the full list of patients again, he/she can enter the command `list patients`. Note that
this command only interacts with the `UniquePersonList` and not the `UniqueAppointmentList`, thus it will not modify
the displayed list of appointments in any way.

3. When user wants to view the full list of appointments again, he/she can enter the command `list appts`. Note that
   this command only interacts with the `UniqueAppointmentList` and not the `UniquePersonList`, thus it will not modify
   the displayed list of patients in any way.

<img src="images/ListActivityDiagram.png" width="500" />

To help you understand what is going on behind the scenes, here is a sequence diagram that demonstrates how
`list patients` work:

<img src="images/ListPatientsSequenceDiagram.png" width="500" />

From the diagram, the `ListCommand` object passes the predicate to show all entries to the `ModelManager`, which
will call onto a JavaFX function to modify the displayed list. For `list appts`, it follows a similar
process as well.

**Aspect: How the command is implemented:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `list patients` and `list appts` as a command words.
  * Pros: No additional parser class required
  * Cons: `ListCommand#execute()` will have more lines of code.
* **Alternative 2:** `list` as a command word with arguments `patients` or `appts` following it.
  * Pros: Seems more aligned with other commands that require more than 1 word of input
  * Cons: Require an additional `ListCommandParser` to work; more lines of code required.

We ultimately went with Alternative 1 since we do not expect `list` to take in many different arguments.

### \[Implemented\] Cancel feature 

#### Implementation
The implemented cancel feature allows users to cancel a patient's appointment based on its index in the appointment list. <br>
It is implemented similar to other idENTify commands and it extends `SelectAppointmentCommand`, an abstract class which encapsulates <br>
operations which require selecting appointments from an appointment list. The logical flow of using this command is shown in the
activity diagram given below.

![Activity Diagram](images/CancelActivityDiagram.png)

The `AddressBookParser` will first check for the `cancel` command word. The cancel command
is facilitated by the `CancelCommandParser` and `CancelCommand` classes. The `CancelCommandParser`
parses the user input and obtains the index inputted by the user, before creating the cancel command to
execute the deletion of the appointment from the current appointment list.
Given below is an overview of how the cancel command executes the deletion of an appointment to delete the
first appointment (index 1) in the appointment list:
![Cancel Command](images/CancelSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How we decided to choose the user command:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Select an appointment index from appointment list
  * Pros: More convenient for the end user to just choose the indexed appointment from the current appointment list.
  * Cons: The details of a patient's appointments will not be shown under the patient's details in the patient's list.

* **Alternative 2:** Use both patient and appointment index to select an appointment to delete.
  itself.
  * Pros: Intuitive if the user just wants to delete a specified patient's appointments.
  * Cons: Appointments will have to be shown under tha patient list which will clutter up the UI.

Our team decided to change the user input format of the cancel command from `cancel PATIENT_INDEX APPOINTMENT_INDEX`
to `cancel APPOINTMENT_INDEX`, so it is faster for
the user to key in, and also more similar to the other commands with only 1 index.

### \[Implemented\] Group Patient

The group mechanism implements the following operations:

* Group patients according to their tags.

The operation is exposed in the `Command` interface as `Command#GroupPatientCommand()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the group mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `idENTify` will be initialized with the initial
patient list.

Step 2. The user executes `group patients` command to group patients by their tags, causing the modified list of
patients after the `group patients` command executes to show on the screen.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute
("group patients")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `group patients` Command](images/GroupPatientSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/GroupPatientCommand.png" width="1000" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How group patients executes:**

* **Current choice:** Use a different comparator from default so that a heavy weight can be assigned to the value of a
  tag group where a patient belongs.

### \[Implemented\] Group Appointment

The group mechanism implements the following operations:

* Group appointments according to their tags or patient.

The operation is exposed in the `Command` interface as `Command#GroupAppointmentCommand()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the group mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `idENTify` will be initialized with the initial
appointment list.

Step 2. The user executes `group appts k/KEY` command to group appointments by their tags `(k/tag)` or patient `
(k/patient)`, causing the modified list of appointments after the `group appts k/KEY` command executes to show on 
the screen.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute
("group appts k/KEY")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `group appts k/KEY` Command](images/GroupAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/GroupAppointmentCommand.png" width="1000" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How group appointments executes:**

* **Current choice:** Use a different comparator from default so that a heavy weight can be assigned to the value of a
  tag group where a patient belongs or the patient attached to the appointment.

### \[Implemented\] Ungroup

The ungroup mechanism implements the following operations:

* Either ungroup appointments or ungroup patients.

The operation is exposed in the `Command` interface as `Command#UngroupCommand()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the group mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `idENTify` will be initialized with the initial
patient and appointment list.

Step 2. The user executes `group appts k/KEY` command to group appointments by their tags `(k/tag)` or patient `
(k/patient)`, causing the modified list of appointments after the `group appts k/KEY` command executes to show on
the screen or executes `group patients` command to group patients by their tags, causing the modified list of
patients after the `group patients` command executes to show on the screen.

Step 3. The user executes `ungroup appts` command to ungroup appointments or `ungroup patients` command to ungroup 
patients.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the use has not group patients or 
appointments, ungroup commands will make no effect on the current addressbook list on the screen.
</div>

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute
("ungroup")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `ungroup` Command](images/UngroupSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/UngroupCommand.png" width="1000" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How ungroup executes:**

* **Current choice:** Use the default comparator for appointments or patients so that the specified list will sort 
  as default settings. To be more specific, the patient list will be sorted by patients' names and the appointemnt 
  list will be sorted by datetime.

### \[Implemented\] Book feature

#### Implementation

The `AddressBookParser` class checks for the `book` command word to begin. The book mechanism is facilitated by the `BookCommandParser` and `BookCommand` classes. The `BookCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and takes in the user input and parses it into an index and 3 string values. The 3 string values are obtained from the `ArgumentMultimap` that checks whether the user has inputted the 3 prefixes supported by this feature.

The 3 prefixes are:
* `r/` for reason
* `d/` for dateTime
* `pe/` for recurring time period (optional)


After retrieving the string values, the `BookCommandParser` executes the `ParserUtil#ParseAppointment()` to convert these values and create an `Appointment` object. A `BookCommand` object will then be created with the given index and `Appointment` object. The `BookCommand` object will retrieve the specified person in the `UniquePersonList` and adds the `Appointment` object to the person's list of appointments.

The newly added `Appointment` object will also be saved in the JSON file through the usage of a Jackson-friendly class `JsonAdaptedAppointment`.

Given below are some example usage scenarios and how the book feature behaves in each scenario.

Scenario 1: User inputs `book 1 r/Sore Throat d/2022-12-10 12:00`. 

The `ParserUtil` class will detect that both the given reason and date are valid, and creates an appointment object to be stored in the specified `Person`, 
only if the `Person` does not have an existing appointment at that date.

Scenario 2: User inputs an empty reason in the `r/` prefix.

The `ParserUtil` class will detect that the given reason is empty and throws a `CommandException`, which will feedback to the user that he has given an invalid reason.

Scenario 3: User inputs an invalid dateTime in the `d/` prefix, such as `2022-15-10 14:00`.

The `ParserUtil` class will detect that the given dateTime is invalid and throws a `CommandException`, which will feedback to the user that he has given an invalid dateTime.

Scenario 4: User inputs an invalid recurring time period in the `pe/` prefix, such as `1S`.

The `ParserUtil` class will detect that the given time period is invalid and throws a `CommandException`, which will feedback to the user that he has given an invalid time period.

Scenario 5: User tries to book an appointment with the same time as other appointments of the same person.

<img src="images/BookCommandObjectDiagram.png" width="450" />

This object diagram illustrates the above scenario. As the specified person has already booked an appointmnet in `Dec 10 2022 12:00`, the newly created `Appointment` object will not be associated with the person. The `BookCommand` will throw a `CommandException`, which will feedback to the user that he tried to book an appointment at the same time as the other appointments.

The following sequence diagram helps to provide a clearer picture to how the book operation works:

![BookSequenceDiagram](images/BookSequenceDiagram.png)

The following Class diagram shows how serializing `Appointment` objects into JSON format is done.

<img src="images/BookCommandStorageClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

`Appointment` objects are mapped to `JsonAdaptedAppointment` objects, so that they contain only relevant fields to store and works easier with Jackson.
These objects are stored in a list field of the `JsonAdaptedPerson` and are stored together in a single JSON file, for easier retrival and assignment when starting up the application.

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: Where to assign Appointment objects:**

* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Each person stores his own list of appointments, as well as the `UniqueAppointmentList` class storing the same objects.
  * Pros: Easier to keep track of which appointments are associated to which person for other appointment related features.
  * Cons: Must ensure both the person's appointments and `UniqueAppointmentList` appointments are equal, in edit/cancel/delete features.

* **Alternative 2:** `Appointment` objects are stored only in the `UniqueAppointmentList` class.
  * Pros: Easier to maintain as there's only one appointment object.
  * Cons: Harder and more costly to track of each person's appointments, especially if the person himself is edited or deleted in the process.

### Mark/Unmark feature

The execution of the `mark`/`unmark` is quite similar to each other, with some minor differences.

Given below is an example usage scenario, where the user enters `mark 1` as the input,
and how the mark mechanism behaves at each step.

![MarkSequenceDiagram](images/MarkSequenceDiagram.png)

The `unmark` command functions similiarly to `mark`, but with the use of `UnmarkCommandParser` and `UnmarkCommand`
classes in place of `MarkCommandParser` and `MarkCommand` respectively.
It also lacks the logic to add recurring appointments.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How mark & unmark executes:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `MarkCommand` and `UnmarkCommand` takes in an `Index` denoting the appointment to
mark/unmark.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Will have to compute the actual appointment to mark `MarkCommand`/`UnmarkCommand` itself.

* **Alternative 2:** `MarkCommand` and `UnmarkCommand` takes in the `Appointment` to be marked as a parameter in its
constructor directly
    * Pros: Cohesiveness is increased, as it only needs to concern itself with marking/unmarking the appointment.
    * Cons: The `CommandResult` object generated at the end of the command will not have the `Index` of the appointment
  recorded in it. This makes it harder to debug using `CommandResult` when bugs occur.

### Find `execute()` implementation

![MarkSequenceDiagram](images/FindClassDiagram.png)

The `find` command,
* Takes in 2 predicates `CombinedPersonPredicate` and `CombinedAppointmentPredicate`.
* `CombinedPersonPredicate` stores all person related search strings and tests for all patients that satisfies all
the search terms.
* `CombinedAppointmentPredicate` stores all appointment related search tags and tests for all appointments that
satisfies all the search terms.
* These 2 predicates are then used together in `FindCommand#execute()` to create a single predicate that displays all 
* the relevant patient and appointments.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to pass in search terms to `FindCommand`:**
* **Alternative 1:** Store all search terms in `FindCommand` and use `Predicate#and` to combine the
the search predicates.
    * Pros: Easy and quick to implement. No extra classes needed.
    * Cons: There is no way to override the `Predicate#equals()`. Testability of `FindCommand` would be low.

* **Alternative 2:** Create 1 class for each search term
(E.g `NameContainsSequencePredicate`, `AppointmentContainsReasonPredicate` etc.). Create a `CombinedPersonPredicate`
and a `CombinedAppointmentPredicate` that takes in all these 'lesser' predicates and combine them to form the actual
predicate to filter the list with.
    * Pros: Testability of `FindCommand` would be very high.
    * Cons: Large amount of classes needed. There would also be the issue of excessive duplication of code.
It would also be time-consuming to add in potential new predicates in the future as much more test cases would be needed
to test each individual class.

* **Alternative 3 (current choice):** Keep the `CombinedPersonPredicate` and `CombinedAppointmentPredicate`,
and store the relevant search terms into each predicate. Combine those search terms in the predicate class itself.
    * Pros: Testability of `FindCommand` would be high. Extending the method features in the future would also be
more efficient than alternative 2.
    * Cons: Slightly less testable than alternative 2. However, the increased efficiency is worth the tradeoff.
